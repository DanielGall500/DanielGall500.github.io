Hi! I'm Daniel. I'm interested in Natural Language Processing, with a particular focus on mechanistic interpretability, language equality projects such as European Language Equality and the improvement of modern tools for minority / low-resource languages. 

I am currently researching the internal representations of syntax (language structure) in transformer-based architectures at [University Leipzig](https://www.uni-leipzig.de/). I additionally enjoy learning more about optimisation, statistics, linear algebra, and investigative data analysis.

I enjoy building software or tools for linguistic research, a typically under-invested area. I'm currently working to release the first version of [MG-Graph](https://github.com/DanielGall500/MG-Graph/), a tool for modelling grammars using graph databases.
