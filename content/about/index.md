I am an independent Freelancer in Natural Language Processing with experience in Python, R and Rust. I have previously worked at the ADAPT AI Research Centre in Dublin on the Machine Translation team where we trained and tested 30 translation models for 6 European languages as well as published the Voss API, an interface for such models to communicate with remote servers as well as live updates of their status. I have been a Top-Rated Freelancer on Upwork specialising in Data Science and NLP solutions.
