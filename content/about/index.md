Hi! I'm Daniel - an independent freelancer from Dublin, Ireland. I focus on building NLP and Data Science products in Python, R, and Rust. My passions are language and computer science, and I find the intersection of the two to be very interesting. Inspired by the late Brett Becker and his computingcrossroads.org project, I have focused on developing my skills in this area and enjoy building NLP solutions. Currently I am undertaking a Computational Linguistics Research Internship under Professor Greg Kobele at the University of Leipzig focusing on building and optimising computational models of grammar using graph databases.
